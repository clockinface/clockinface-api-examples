# ClockInFace API Examples – Facial Recognition Attendance API

This repository contains **official API examples and interactive demos** for the
**ClockInFace Facial Recognition Attendance API**, a production-ready backend for
building biometric attendance systems, employee clock-in / clock-out workflows,
and identity verification using face recognition.

These examples are intended for **developers, system integrators, and product teams**
implementing facial recognition–based attendance or access control systems.

## What Is ClockInFace?

ClockInFace provides a secure, scalable backend API for:

- Facial recognition attendance systems
- Biometric clock-in and clock-out
- Identity verification with face images
- Workforce automation and access control platforms

The API is designed for real-world deployments where accuracy, explainability,
and backend control matter.

Official documentation is available at

## 🚀 Quick Start – Facial Recognition API Demo (Google Colab)

The fastest way to try the ClockInFace API is through an **interactive Google Colab notebook**.

👉 **[Open the ClockInFace API Colab Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/)**  
(Upload `clockinface_api_colab_demo.ipynb` from this repository)

The demo walks through a complete facial recognition workflow, including:

- Secure Bearer token authentication
- Registering persons with face images
- Facial recognition for known and unknown faces
- Listing persons and face embeddings
- Attendance-ready identity verification flows

No local setup is required.

## 🧩 About This Repository

This repository focuses exclusively on **practical API usage examples**.
It is not a marketing showcase.

The goal is to provide clear, working reference implementations for developers
building facial recognition attendance systems who want transparency, control,
and a clean backend API.

If you are evaluating or integrating biometric attendance using face recognition,
these examples are the recommended starting point.
