# ClockInFace Facial Recognition Attendance API

ClockInFace is a **production-ready facial recognition API** designed for building
**employee attendance systems**, biometric clock-in / clock-out workflows, and
identity verification platforms using face recognition.

This API is intended for **developers and system builders** who need a reliable,
transparent backend for biometric attendance — without opaque SDKs or vendor lock-in.

---

## What Problem Does ClockInFace Solve?

Traditional attendance systems rely on badges, PINs, or devices that are easy to
share, forget, or misuse.

ClockInFace enables **face-based attendance** by providing:

- Identity verification using facial recognition
- Secure, API-driven clock-in and clock-out flows
- Centralized backend control for biometric systems
- Support for multi-location and multi-device deployments

The system is designed to integrate cleanly into existing workforce or access
control platforms.

---

## Core Capabilities

ClockInFace provides REST APIs for:

- Facial recognition and identity matching
- Registering persons with face images
- Managing face embeddings
- Attendance-ready identity verification workflows
- Secure token-based authentication

All operations are exposed through standard HTTPS endpoints and can be used from
web, mobile, or embedded systems.

---

## Typical Use Cases

ClockInFace is commonly used to build:

- Employee attendance tracking systems
- Biometric clock-in / clock-out applications
- Facial recognition access control
- On-site workforce validation tools
- Multi-branch or distributed attendance platforms

---

## API Examples and Interactive Demo

If you want to see the API in action, start with the official examples:

👉 **[ClockInFace API Examples on GitHub](https://github.com/clockinface/clockinface-api-examples)**

The repository includes an **interactive Google Colab notebook** demonstrating:

- Bearer token authentication
- Person registration with face images
- Facial recognition (known and unknown users)
- Listing persons and face embeddings
- End-to-end attendance identity flows

No local setup is required.

## API Endpoint Overview

**Base URL**
https://clockinface.com/backend/api/v1/


The API follows standard REST conventions and returns JSON responses suitable for
direct integration into backend services or client applications.

## Documentation

- Official website and documentation:  
  👉 https://clockinface.com
- API examples and demos:  
  👉 https://github.com/clockinface/clockinface-api-examples

## Design Principles

ClockInFace is built around a few core ideas:

- **Explainable behavior** over black-box decisions
- **Backend control** instead of locked client SDKs
- **Production focus**, not demos or toy examples
- **Developer-first documentation**

This makes it suitable for long-term, real-world biometric deployments.
